      <h1>About Me</h1>
          <h3 style="LINE-HEIGHT: 0px"><i>Education / Career</i></h3>
          <p>
              I am a Game Programmer and graduate (Dec 2017) of Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy. I am interested
              in VR, RPG, MMOs, and FPS. During my time at FIEA, I have developed 8 games with 8 groups of people, with one 
              group where I was lead programmer. 5 of those games are 2-week rapid prototypes, 1 is a semester long educational 
              VR game, and another is the 2-semester long Capstone that is the core of FIEA. My final game/project is actually 
              published on Steam and is called Oracle: Threads of Fate. 
          </p>

          <p> For the past 5 years (2020-2025), I've been working at the Fintech company
              Fidelity National Information Services. The first 6 months I was on a team that created the Standards and Guidelines
              for API development and documentation. I then moved to another project where I was mainly a back-end developer for a 
              web-based accounting system, with a very small amount of time on the front-end.
          </p>

          <p>
              I plan to further develop my <a href="Pages/Skills.html">skills</a> and would love to make video games, but 
              I am also willing to work on any other kind of project, from Healthcare to Defense and anything in between.
