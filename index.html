            <h3 style="LINE-HEIGHT: 0px"><i>Education, Goals, etc.</i></h3>
            <p>
                I am a Game Programmer and graduate (Dec 2017) of Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy. I am interested
                in VR, RPG, MMOs, and FPS. I have experience with Unity 5, Unreal Engine 4, C/C++/C#, and Perforce. During
                my time at FIEA, I have developed 8 games with 8 groups of people, with one group where I was lead programmer.
                5 of those games are 2-week rapid prototypes, 1 is a semester long educational VR game, and another is the
                2-semester long Capstone that is the core of FIEA. My final game/project is actually published on Steam and
                is called Oracle: Threads of Fate. I am currently trying to teach my self Python, MySql, HTML, CSS, & Javascript
                while maintaining my Unity/Unreal Engine skills.
